## Overview

**Rhythm Rush** is a browser-based rhythm game inspired by *Audition Online*, a nostalgic favorite from my childhood. This project was a hands-on exploration into 3D graphics using **Three.js** via **React Three Fiber**, with the goal of creating an interactive and animated experience entirely in the browser.

It combines real-time user input, BPM-synced events, and 3D character animations rendered with WebGL â€” all within a React ecosystem.
